## BERT Email Spam Classifier



This project implements an email spam classifier using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and TensorFlow. BERT is a powerful pre-trained language model that has shown great success in various NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks, including text classification.

## Features

- **BERT-based Model**: Utilizes the BERT pre-trained model for text encoding.
- **Spam Classification**: Predicts whether an email is spam or not spam.
